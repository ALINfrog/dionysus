## Code of Conduct
The main thing here is *be nice*, be considerate to others. This includes writing clear, documented code!

Please include clear commit/PR comments, reference issues etc - this is helpful for anyone trying to follow along.

If you want to suggest or implement new features - open an issue, make a PR! Anything that's useful without cluttering the UI too much is welcomed.




## Codestyle

Conform to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) as much as possible/sensible. 

Clear, well documented code is the goal. 

Document. 

Use [typehints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). This can be invaluable for avoiding/finding bugs!


## Documentation

So far documentation conforms roughly to a reST/Sphinx style

"""
This is a reST style. 
Miss a line between docstring text and parameters/return/exceptions.
If there are multiple parameters, multiple potential errors raise/handled, it can be clearer
to separate the grouped 

:param param0: type explantion
:param param1: str this is explanation for first param
:param param2: this is a second param
:returns: this is a description of what is returned
:raises keyError: raises an exception
